# IPCexecuter

This is a programming assignment for my CSCE 313 (intro to computer systems) class. It sets up a class hierarchy, where a request channel is the parent and message queue, shared memory, and FIFO interprocess communication classes are the inherited classes. The client can request multiple data points or entire files from the server via any of these 3 IPC methods.
